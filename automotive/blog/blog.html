      <h2>My First Car</h2>
      <h5>February 14, 2022</h5>
      <img src="Lude Front.jpg" style="height:200px;"></img>
      <p>On one cold February morning, only a few weeks into my fourth semester of high school, my dad and I climbed into his five-speed 2000 Audi A4 Avant and began the hour-long drive west to Marshall, Michigan. The dear old family wagon, characterized by an unopenable CD changer, the least durable front control arms devised by man, some very loud valve lifters, and a distinct lack of synchros in reverse gear, would be making its last trip of any real note that day. We were on the way to pick up my first car.</p>
      <p>I honestly don’t remember my year of fifth-gen Prelude ownership very vividly. It being my first car, there was little to contextualize it against. My first encounter with it was sitting in the very cramped back seat, watching my dad row the questionably-tasteful Mugen shifter, about 10 inches tall and bright blue. The H22A sounded raspy from right over the muffler, none of the brake surfaces were even remotely two-dimensional, and the ride felt heavier than the car’s ~2900lb spec would have you believe. It was a beautiful shade of green, Ficus Pearl, that stood out against the snow and grey Michigan skies, and perfectly complemented the rusty orange pockmarks over the wheel arches, along the skirts, and in the trunk lid. The valve cover was suspiciously spray-painted primer white, a previous owner had installed a K&N hot air intake, and it had enough miles to have been around the world ten times. I’m sure I was wooed; it was a car, after all, and I was fifteen. I watched $2500 exchange hands, a price that could only be a fever dream these days, and gazed at the wide rear fascia as we tailed the seller to the nearest Secretary of State.</p>
      <p>That spring, I drove that car at every possible opportunity. First gear pulls around parking lots, late-night jaunts to the local twisty road, to and from friends’ houses with questionable legality. I road-tripped to Chicago in it without telling my parents, ran local autocross, drag-raced my friend’s F100s and 2.5L Jettas. Much of the time, it reeked of coin-fed carwash shampoo, a pungent artificial strawberry aroma. After an app-verified 16 second pass, it would smell vaguely of burnt motor oil and wet dog. I would visit it during school sometimes, just to listen to music on the papery old “acoustic feedback system” speakers, or to sit in the parking lot and watch rain traverse the leaky sunroof seals. In seven months, I had put five thousand miles on the car, a number that only becomes noteworthy when you realize I only had a driver’s license for half that time.</p>
      <p>Not coincidentally I’m sure, the first time I drove it with a license, it decided that three would be an appropriate amount of cylinders for a freeway cruise. It was late, maybe one in the morning, and I was about a half-mile into the drive home from a friend’s, where we had been trying to record a song. I limped it home, and spent a few days biting nails, browsing forums, pondering why my car had decided to give up the whole “driving” thing after quarter-million miles. Eventually, I decided it must be misfiring because of a clogged EGR system, and set out to remedy the issue. It was a very involved job, and was certainly my most serious undertaking at the time. I did a lot of things wrong (by necessity), damaged parts of the car (and of myself), and when I started the car after several hours, it ran like shit. Sputtering, barely holding idle, spewing white smoke out of the tailpipe, I was worried I had been wrong. I drove it anyway, and long story short, I was right. I went on to sell the car about three months later. Its replacement is a 1991 Miata, which I have to this day. That car is one that I love, one that I have taken to fifteen states over the course of 35,000 miles, that has seen two engines in half a dozen states of tune, that has seen the muddy side of a country road ditch, that has gotten a little too intimate with the bumper of an F150, that has had a backpack stolen through its rear window, that has seen track time and mountain passes and interstates, and that has never, ever let me down.</p>
      <p>Since I was first left without a car that summer night, I have donated more and more thought to what my cars have meant to me. They can be vehicles (pun unintended) for extrapersonal empathy, just like conversation, music, and art. Cars provide ways to project pieces of your identity, share them with others, observe and manipulate them, and have them reflected back to you in new ways. Approaching them with this awareness, an intent to actively participate, and a willingness to understand and empathize with the thoughts and emotions they carry has brought me closer to myself and to many others. While my Miata may be a better fit for me than a neglected Prelude, I now have just as much respect for either of those cars as I do for the one that really started it all: a bright green plush VW Beetle toy that I used as a crutch when I was learning to crawl, before I can even remember.</p>

      <h2>Second Person</h2>
      <h5>February 1, 2022</h5>
      <img src="PSX_20190121_095545.jpg" style="height:200px;"</div>
      <p>Northern Wisconsin can probably be most aptly described as “vast” and “featureless”. From US-8, the view across your hood is populated mostly by tall grass, cattails, and the occasional stand of white pine or short row of leafless birches, each one lonelier than the last as you head west toward Minnesota. In the dead of winter, each detail you might otherwise live in, even for a moment, a farmhouse, a marshy pond, a poorly-signed turn-off to a small town drag, is obscured by a dense veil of snow. At night in the dead of winter, every last semblance of a landmark is erased from view.</p>
      <p>Although US-8 goes all the way from the border in Norway, Michigan to Minneapolis itself, it’s very easy to get lost in Northern Wisconsin. It’s easy to lose yourself in the snow, in the big, dark, sky full of stars, in the drone of the engine, in the gentle rhythm of the cracked pavement rolling under the tires. If your car is well-engineered, it too will disappear from the experience. You can turn off your dash lights and the night will brighten, the stars coming closer to the earth. You can turn off your radio and let your thoughts harmonize with the thrumming engine, let them keep time with the cracked pavement. Eventually, they will fade away altogether. It’s hard to hold onto a salient moment for long when you’re eight hours in on Clif bars and gas station coffee, but it’s a meditative state, not a sleepy one.</p>
      <p>Cattails on the right.</p>
      <p>White pines on either side.</p>
      <p>An unlit house half a mile from the road.</p>
      <p>A plowed field of dead corn stalks.</p>
      <p>Two cars going the the other way.</p>
      <p>Orion's bow hazily reflected in a frozen pond.</p>
      <p>A royal oak tree standing tall in the distance.</p>
      <p>A deer lookin gyou right in the eye.</p>
      <p>Approaching a blank landscape with a blank mind is almost hallucinatory. While you’re certain that the deer you saw was real, you can’t say the same for the intrigued stare you shared with it as you rushed by. The sky could be purple, or orange, or a dim fluorescent blue, it depends when you look at it. You start to live out brief lives in the landscape, as a coyote hunting for fowl among the cattails, as a farmer building a fire to keep the dark away, as a lonely white pine shaking off the snow in the wake of a solitary motorist rushing by. In a way, each of these little selves you attune yourself to as you move through the world are real, a fixture of your fleeting relationships with the view through the windshield, each one a new piece of your caffeine-addled, barely-nourished identity. You are blinded by the piercing orange shine of the gas light.</p>
      <p>There are two other cars at the local Gulf franchisee. A mud- and salt-caked one-ton Ram, probably a decade old and adorned with farm plates and a dually rear axle, sits in front of the diesel pump. It is clicking slowly as it cools in the wintery breeze, and has a sleepy, honest demeanor. A brand new Audi is parked, running, in front of the store, a shining neo-bauhaus anachronism perched awkwardly among the old mechanical fuel pumps and weathered white cinder blocks. A woman sits in the passenger side, bathed in the pulsating glow of her phone. Roman Mars’ voice bleeds out from inside, and you can almost discern his careful, meditated words. When you walk inside, you meet a tired-looking man in a boiler suit comparing two cases of beer, and two young women, presumably the staff, arranging souvenir mugs on a shelf and quietly arguing in inoffensive midwestern accents about somebody’s stepmother’s intention to send someone’s grandfather to a nursing home “in the city”. They probably mean Eau Claire. You absent-mindedly generate enough words to find out that the coffee is cheap and warm, and that the bathrooms are to the left, behind the counter. You return to your car, to your meditations, and resist the urge to set your cruise control at a triple-digit speed.</p>
