        <h2>100 Words</h2>
        <h5>February 24, 2022</h5>
        <p>It’s hard to know if I should even call it a house, it’s so large and ornate. They claim to be an educational institution of some kind, a charity. Each time, I take note of the cars parked there, the people I see through the windows (often working by candlelight), the others I encounter walking. They are uneasy to see me walking, so I shy to the other side of the drive. I am uneasy to see them, uneasy, walking. Each time I go to Anna’s, I walk up a hill, along a private drive, past this uneasy house.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I always thought they looked like teeth. They’re a little bulbous, a little bent, a critical part of that dopey, wide-eyed smile. They’re not white, either, but speckled with brown, looped around little stays at their tops, the only things you can really see in the ovoid opening. Once, climbing out of a ditch, one snapped off. It was probably too rusty, after all those years sipping salt water in the winters. Now the smile is a little snaggletooth. It’s endearing.</p>

        <h2>What is a Photo?</h2>
        <h5>January 20, 2022</h5>
        <p>Recently, in my ongoing escapades of personal growth, I’ve been donating a lot of thought to extrapersonal vehicles for empathy. Conversation, music, writing, and art of any kind all provide ways to project pieces of your identity, share them with others, observe and manipulate them, and have them reflected back to you in new ways. Approaching art with this awareness, an intent to actively participate, and a willingness to understand and empathize with the thoughts and emotions it carries has brought me closer to myself and to many others. While my experience of this phenomenon centers around music these days, photography is what introduced me to it.</p>
        <p>My relationship to photography began, with any seriousness, early in high school. Before I met my art teacher (and dear friend), I rarely took photos and never appeared in them. I hadn’t ever considered that they could be a piece of someone or that I could learn about myself from them. Then again, it’s quite difficult to be so self-aware when you’re fourteen. I had no idea how much I would be changed when I registered for the first of what would soon become many photography courses with one Steve Coron.</p>
        <p>Steve is an all-loving, curious, observant, and profoundly optimistic person, and although he was never the best academic, he was an excellent teacher. He made an effort to develop a mutual respect and cognizance with his students, an effort which I really took to heart. I learned not from him, but with him. And as it happened, Steve learned by taking pictures. He would speak about what he found beautiful in a particular photograph, and we would both learn in what way the parts of us that saw that beauty were themselves beautiful. As we changed, our photographs changed with us, a persistent coevolution of conversation and conversationalist. Photographs, then, are portals into ephemeral moments, emotions, and experiences, although not quite concrete themselves. They are things you create, which are mutually influenced not only by the moments when they are captured, but also by the moments when they are viewed, to say nothing of the especially poignant moments in between. Photos have an elegant turbulence to them. They are breathing and changing, getting seen and used again, with different people, at different times, and in different places. They can make a singular emotion or experience into a multifaceted  miniature universe.</p>
        <p>We often spoke about using photography as a kind of mindfulness. When you have awareness and intention, capturing a photograph takes the randomness of light away. It gives you agency over your life. Often, I walk through the world as it blazes by me, no more than chaotic ambiance. But seeing with a purpose brings a decisive calm, and allows me to exist in a brief but beautiful moment. Capturing that moment is sort of like making art out of art. Little self-conceptions come and go like guests quickly passing through my mind unless I hold onto them. I have learned that many of them really are beautiful enough to hold onto, to revisit them in the darkroom and converse like old friends, and to give an open invitation to my mind by keeping them nearby. I have captured not just instances of light, but instances of my ever-changing sense of self.</p>
        <p>These unexpected beautiful little identities give me permission to be myself. There are days when I don’t remember how to connect with my friends, my surroundings, or even my own body. Art can overcome that obstacle. It imbues my life with meaning, gives it a purpose that is entirely my own, makes connections and inspires universality, and brings me closer to living. Seeing novel parts in the light is how I see new parts of myself and the people around me. It ensures community and empathy. There is always the possibility of thoughtfulness and generosity when you press the shutter release.</p>
        <p>I will end this essay (ramble?) as I ended my hasty speech to Steve at my high school graduation: “The one thing that keeps me grounded, keeps me personable, and keeps me downright happy, is going outside and taking a nice long look at the world.”</p>

      <h2>Pervasive Data Collection and the Attention Economy</h2>
      <h5>May 05, 2021</h5>
      <p>The internet and everything internet-connected have become a network of invisible data
        transactions. Thanks to the advent of digital quantification devices such as the Facebook Like, which
        transform end user engagement into commensurable and analyzable data, every single interaction between
        a person and this network eventually generates tradeable data. Contributions to this data economy are
        micro-transactional and often go undisclosed. Ongoing developments of the “Internet of Things,”
        user-facing product integration, and attention-grabbing interfaces make it nearly unavoidable. The broad
        purpose of this seemingly infinite data harvest is to derive ‘valuable’ information, to make money. But
        then, what is ‘valuable’ information? How does its economic role affect you, the end user?
        </p>
        <p>While there are many voicing concerns over privacy or regulation, there is little discussion of the
            commodification of personal data itself, which I believe operates through ‘accumulation by
            dispossession’, a neoliberal capitalist form of value accumulation and centralization defined by Marxist
            geographer David Harvey (“Accumulation by Dispossession”). I argue that data only becomes valuable
            when combined and compared algorithmically with huge amounts of other commensurable data by a data
            collection tool. It becomes commodified by dispossessing that tool’s end users of the identifying factors
            of their everyday lives, during both productive and supposedly unproductive time. And, in Marxist terms,
            it alienates those same end users from their product when that produced value is not wholly reflected in
            the use value of the tool in question. Furthermore, it is the nature of this economy that it should lend itself
            to prey on the attention of its end users. This attention dispossession has dramatic ethical and personal
            implications in and of itself.</p>
            <p>While the information-age buzzword ‘big data’ is now a familiar one, its meaning is not always
                immediately obvious. Wikipedia, a model product of this information age, says it is “a global digital
                ecosystem in which data is gathered, organized, and exchanged by a network of vendors for the purpose
                of deriving value from the accumulated information... [wherein] data inputs are collected by a variety of
                actors including search engines, social media websites, [both] online [and] brick and mortar vendors,
                payment gateways, software as a service (SaaS) purveyors, and an increasing number of firms deploying
                connected devices on the Internet of Things (IoT).” (“Data Economy”) While Wikipedia’s definition is
                effectively accurate, a, earlier, more technical definition from a Gartner business intelligence report
                (Laney, 2001) is the “three Vs” - volume, velocity, and variety. To paraphrase, big data is only ‘big’ if it
                consists of a perpetually increasing volume of several varieties of data, communicated at high speeds, to
                and from a broad range of sources. Critically, Laney also says that big data “demand[s] cost-effective,
                innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making.” He implies that
                the stress of big data is in data analysis - in other words, the singular un-processed datum is useless. The
                goal of all this data collection is not to store it for the sake of possessing it, but to process and analyze
                huge quantities of it. in the name of efficient and profitable decision making - deciding to show you a
                Starbucks advertisement in the morning after Google Maps detects your habit of going to a competing
                coffee shop before lunch, for example.</p>
        <p>Big Data as we have come to know it began with the monetization of the internet. Although it is
            hard to say quite when that happened, it is obvious that the internet, in its adolescence, was simply limited
            by the capabilities of contemporary networking hardware. Internet services were not yet widely-available
            commodities. The acceleration of digital technology is notable however, and by the late 1990s, things
            were rapidly changing. During this ‘dot-com’ boom, server prices dropped considerably and information
            became dramatically easier to access, driven by increasingly cheap digital storage and ever-advancing
            networking technology, in combination with rushed telecommunications laws that greatly deregulated
            ISPs and online markets. By the end of 2000, Google had launched AdWords, ostensibly the first
            noteworthy application of big data. AdWords displays personalized advertisements and search results to
            users by monitoring and analyzing their search keywords and browsing habits. As of 2018, 86% of
            Google’s total revenue comes from its big data advertising platforms like AdWords, AdSense, and
            DoubleClick (“Google Ads”). Google legally lays claim to all of the information you generate, beginning
            the instant you unwittingly click through their product’s EULA. This is a practice shared by almost every
            big data company.
            </p>
        <p>The breadth of circumstances and extent to which data is collected goes well beyond just
            geolocation tracking and search history monitoring, however. Anita Allen says in her article “Protecting
            One’s Own Privacy in a Big Data Economy”, “typical consumers and internet users do not understand the
            extent to which their activities generate data that is being collected, analyzed, and put to use for varied
            governmental and business purposes.” The ancillary, micro-transactional nature of data collection makes
            the data economy hard to grasp. In the same article’s abstract, Allen says that “individuals invisibly
            contribute to Big Data whenever they live digital lifestyles or otherwise participate in the digital economy,
            such as when they shop with a credit card, get treated at a hospital, apply for a job online, research a topic
            on Google, or post on Facebook.” In fact, the background microtransactions were what set Google
            AdWords apart from its competition. Since even before its October, 2000 debut, AdWords has remained
            largely the same: you use the product, you see an ad, the ad happens to be personally relevant to you. The
            data collection, analysis, and application are all invisible. This is true of many other big data systems,
            from Spotify tracking the music you like most to Amazon Echo recording your day-to-day conversations.
            Each of these discrete sources generates a constant and consistent flow of information that, in summary,
            becomes your digital copy. It is created by “abstracting [a] human [body] from [its] territorial settings and
            separating [it] into a distinct series of discrete flows,” which are able to be reinterpreted, recontextualized,
            and, in Marxist terms, do work.
            </p>
        <p>Robert Atkinson’s article “IP Protection in the Data Economy: Getting the Balance Right on 13
            Critical Issues” provides some inquiry into what makes this data tradeable. He makes the important
            connection between the emerging personal data economy and a much more well-established section of
            commodifiable data: intellectual property law. Atkinson explores IP governance approaches as they relate
            to big data. He worries that “[data and IP] regimes that tilt too far toward granting data rights run the risk
            of stifling needed data sharing, while regimes that tilt too far in the other direction risk limiting incentives
            for data collection and innovation.” He also poses the question: “how should we conceptualize the role
            data has come to play in the economy?” Although he attempts to answer it in one way, in the context of
            IP, and others answer it in the contexts of politics and regulation, I aim to answer it in another: the context
            of value, both personal and economic.
            </p>
        <p>It should be obvious that data collection is valuable. Ten years ago, McKinsey Global Institute
            estimated that personal geolocation information alone could create $600 billion per year (Manyika et al.,
            2011). While data broking companies often operate behind closed doors for fear of public retaliation, data
            sales by mobile carriers were estimated at approximately $24 billion per year (Kaye 2015). Speculative
            valuations of data broking companies are also frequently very optimistic, despite the fact that they usually
            have little or no valuable resources other than their users’ personal data and their ability to gather more.
            For instance, Snapchat was valued at $35 billion on its IPO (Statt, 2016). Google acquired Nest, a
            data-collecting “smart home” product maker, for $3.2 billion (Wohlsen, 2014), a few years before it
            bought the fitness tracking company FitBit for $2.1 billion (Gartenburg, 2019). But the valuations
            associated with these companies don’t explain themselves.
            </p>
        <p>The data broking companies themselves aren’t the workers in this system. The end users are, and
            we do the work voluntarily. We are partially compensated with access to the same tools that collect our
            personal data, tools like Google Maps that use your commuting habits and those of thousands of others to
            derive the fastest route from your home to your workplace via your favorite breakfast joint, or Sleepbot,
            an app that monitors your movement and fitness data while you sleep (which is a terrifyingly dystopian
            prospect) and promises to wake you up when you will be least groggy, giving you feedback on how to
            sleep better. This is an interesting blurring of the line between productive ‘work-time’ and unproductive
            ‘leisure time’. The Fordist notion of a twenty-four hour work day includes eight hours for work, eight
            hours for sleep, and eight hours for what you will. In this new reconstruction of the day, we are being
            productive even when sleeping and doing ‘what you will’, which is often just scrolling through Twitter or
            watching Netflix. Even (or, perhaps, especially) if the only rewards we get are ‘likes’, we toil away day in
            and day out, expanding the depth and breadth of our digital identities. And since the generation of data
            produces value in a Lockean sense, we should not question just the content of the information, but the
            origin of the information: ourselves, the laborers.
            </p>
        <p>It should be clear that doing nothing, or at least not engaging with data collection tools, is not
            considered productive. The end users, then, are motivated to participate by a number of implements. IoT
            devices incorporate data collection tools into everyday tasks like answering the doorbell, adjusting the
            lights, or cooking dinner. Often, devices like this are well-integrated with more traditional, familiar digital
            environments like your phone and laptop, creating a ‘walled garden’ effect that makes it both rewarding
            to operate them within that environment, and difficult or impossible not to. These environments
            themselves are frequently designed with predatory interfaces, meant to capture and hold the attention of
            users with constant vivid stimulus. And, of course, the fundamental quantification devices that enable the
            data economy are rewards in and of themselves. Seeing how many steps you walked in a day or how
            many people engaged with your Instagram post is fun and, since they are meant to capture a version of
            you, can provide some shallow reinforcement of your identity.</p>
        <p>‘Accumulation by dispossession’ refers to a series of neoliberal capitalist practices “that result in
            a centralization of wealth and power in the hands of a few by dispossessing the public and private entities
            of their wealth or land.” (“Accumulation by Dispossession”) It is a unique, more contemporary
            understanding of ‘primitive accumulation’, which is about the origin of capital, and the class distinctions
            between those with capital and those without. Financialization, or the aggregation of exchange value into
            financial instruments, is the stress of this accumulation with regard to big data. Examples of the financial
            instruments include money, debt, or equity. Big data accumulates valuable data into the hands of the
            purveyors of data collection tools by dispossessing the tools’ users of their personal identifiers. The main
            result of data dispossession is the creation of abstracted, quantified, and tradeable digital copies of each
            end user. These capitalist processes transform simple information about any given person into distinct,
            commensurable observations, which are then analyzed and algorithmically processed into a procedure of
            useful data points that quantify the end user, amounting to what becomes their digital copy. These digital
            copies carry exchange value. They are commodities. In fact, they are used almost exclusively to enhance
            the commodification and exchange of yet more (big) data.
            </p>
        <p>Accumulation by dispossession is ethically and personally problematic, as it can lead to the
            alienation of entire populations (“Accumulation by Dispossession”). Transferring productive assets to
            private companies undermines the natural connection between the laborers and these assets, and can upset
            the power structure in place. In this regard, the big data economy is particularly troubling. By
            participating in it, people can even be dispossessed of legal ownership over their personal traits (“Google
            Ads”). This redefinition of identity, attaching it to quantifiable modes of consumption, isn’t just of
            (hopefully obvious) personal, existential concern. Reducing your personality to a broadly appealing
            unidimensional digital brand, one that doesn't even technically belong to you, can be immensely
            depressing. It can also lead to monoculturalistic behavior, as individual users all try to optimize their
            digital presence for better engagement metrics on any particular platform. There is also the question of
            accountability and intellectual probability, which Atkinson’s “IP Protection in the Data Economy” tackles
            in depth. Jenny Odell’s Talk At Google “How to Do Nothing” addresses it in a more approachable
            manner, however. She collects and recontextualizes found objects, then placing them neatly on shelves for
            display. This drives a member of the audience to ask, “Are you redefining art?”. The real question there,
            as with big data, is whether the original creator of each asset or the entity in charge of collecting and
            recontextualizing them should be held accountable for the final product. In many cases, it is the latter.
            Jenny is considered the artist despite the fact that she was not the original creator of each object, and
            Instagram reserves the right to adapt and redistribute your photographs despite the fact that no one at
            Instagram was the original photographer.</p>
        <p>There are also monumental ethical issues, with the amount and detail of identifiable data creating
            notable risk of predatory behavior like disclosures, blackmail, and identity theft, as well as targeted
            discriminatory behavior like price gouging or denial of service in many contexts, or redlining and other
            housing issues. This creates a demand for privacy, which, if not carefully regulated, can be sold.
            Stacy-Ann Elvy examines this phenomenon in her article “Paying for Privacy and the Personal Data
            Economy”, establishing two models that can be used when vying for tradeable data: “the emerging
            "personal data economy" (PDE) in which companies purchase data directly from individuals [and] at the
            opposite end of the spectrum, the "pay for-privacy" (PFP) model.” The article claims that “PFP models
            facilitate the transformation of privacy into a valuable, tradable product, and may induce or worsen
            unequal access to privacy, and could further enable predatory and discriminatory behavior… [and] while
            the PDE model may allow consumers to regain a semblance of control over their information by enabling
            them to decide when and with whom to share their data, consumers' direct transfer or disclosure of
            personal data to companies for a price or personalized deals creates challenges similar to those found in
            the PFP context and generates additional concerns associated with innovative monetization techniques.”</p>
        <p>Big data has a huge (and only growing) role in our daily lives, no matter how unnoticeable and
            unexplainable its function may be. I have explained a small scope of the economic, ethical, and personal
            roles played by data that are created by frequent microtransactions and commodified by dispossessing end
            users of their very being. Still, this is only a part of the huge subject that is the political data economy. My
            perspective as an American is mostly limited to the United State’s characteristics and practices. The
            regional evolution of data regimes is not at all uniform. There are extreme examples such as Myanmar,
            where only 1.16% of citizens have access to the internet (Groden, 2015), and China, where the state
            operates a ‘Great Firewall’ that completely governs internet access (“Internet in China”). Also, ‘big data’
            as it is addressed in this paper is limited to only ‘valuable’ data, which cannot exceed what is effectively
            capturable by current data gathering tools. To be fair, that is also the primary interest of big data brokers,
            who need commensurable, valuable data to enable its commodification and exchange.
